# Crying Tools
Crying Tools is a Minecraft mod that expands upon the Crying Obsidian; with new tools, armor, blocks, items and an ore.

Crying adds:
- 5 New Advancements
- 5 New Tools
- 4 New Trimmable Armor
- 3 New Blocks
- 2 New Items
- 1 New Ore

## Crying Ore
Crying Ore is a very rare ore that generates both in the Nether and the Overworld.

In the Nether; it has the identical generation properties of the Ancient Debris, meaning it generates in the form of scatter ores. However, Crying Ore **can** be fully exposed to air unlike Ancient Debris.

In the Overworld; it has the identical generation properites of the Diamond Ore instead and it generates as a normal ore, the only differences being Crying Ore generates 3x less and it can be fully exposed to air.

When mined (with a Diamond Pickaxe or better), it drops a **Crying Residue** which can be used to craft a **Crying Ingot**. The block itself can be smelted into Crying Ingots aswell.

## Crying Residue
Crying Residue is an item obtained from Crying Ore, it can be used to craft a **Crying Ingot** with Netherite Ingots and one Crying Obsidian.

## Crying Ingot
Crying Ingot is an item to upgrade Netherite equipment to Crying ones, it's also a trim material that can be used with any armor and trim template!

Even though Crying Ingot can be crafted with residues, it can also be crafted without them if you have some netherite ingots to spare.

![no_residue](https://i.ibb.co/GcwDsBC/Ekran-g-r-nt-s-2024-12-08-162236.png "no_residue")

It can also be crafted with only crying ingredients.

![no_netherite](https://i.ibb.co/1srHSnm/Ekran-g-r-nt-s-2024-12-26-191151.png "no_netherite")

1-2 Crying Ingots can be found in Bridge and Treasure bastions with **20**% and **22.5**% chance respectively.

## Crying Upgrade Smithing Template
You also need a Crying Upgrade Smithing Template with a Crying Ingot to upgrade Netherite Equipment. To craft one, you need one **Hard Crying Obsidian**, one Iron Ingot and seven Netherrack.

A Hard Crying Obsidian is a block that cries 4 times more than **Crying Obsidian**, and it only can be used to craft a **Crying Upgrade Smithing Template**. To craft it, you need 8 **Ghast Tears** and 1 Crying Obsidian.

#### **Enchantability**

## Crier
When you wear any piece of Crying Armor, you're granted an effect called **Crier** (![cry](https://i.ibb.co/P1kMJ94/crier.png "cry")). The more pieces of Crying Armor you wear, the stronger the Crier effect gets. The effect is permanent unless no piece of Crying Armor is worn.

Crier effect gives you **Resistance** and **Strength**. Even though the Crier effect gets stronger when you wear more Crying Armor, Strength will never stack. This means even if you wear a full set of Crying Armor, the Crier effect you have will only give you Strength **I**. This is not the case for Resistance however, and it stacks.

The Crier effect doesn't affect normal Resistance and Strength effects.

## Bane of Criers
Bane of Criers (![bane](https://i.ibb.co/HgbH5Z8/bane-of-criers-effect.png "bane")) is both a **Status Effect** and an **Enchantment**.
If a **weapon** enchanted with Bane of Criers is used on a living entity, the entity will be given the status effect. When an entity has the Bane of Criers effect, it will take 2 times more damage from all damage types. The duration of the effect depends on the enchantment level, the formula being `2.5 + 1 * (level - 1)`.

When an entity has the Bane of Criers, they will cry.
(![crying](https://i.ibb.co/Jdk3pY5/qqq.gif "crying"))

The enchanted book can be traded with librarian villagers, can be found on enchantment tables and ominous vaults in Trial Chambers.
